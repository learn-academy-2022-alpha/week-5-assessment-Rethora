# ASSESSMENT 5: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a block in Ruby?

  Your answer: A block is an anonymous function. It is a block of code that is not tied to a variable name. Some examples include sections of code defined by do, if, elsif, else, callbacks and while with their corresponding end. A block is not called later on, so there is no need to assign a name to it.

  Researched answer: Ruby blocks are anonymous functions similar to JavaScript. They are created with do/end or with {}. Blocks DO NOT contain if, elsif and else.

2. What is a gem?

  Your answer: A gem is a Ruby package/library that can be installed. I've noticed when you create a new Ruby on Rails application a lot of these gems are installed. This makes setting up backend code much easier for a developer.

  Researched answer: A gem is preexisting code (library). Gems can be used to package Ruby code to make it easy to share with other developers.

3. What is Ruby on Rails?

  Your answer: Rails is an framework written in Ruby for fullstack applications. It allows developers to work on backend code more easily by running commands and having code be generated for working with databases.

  Researched answer: Ruby on Rails is an open source server-side web application framework written in Ruby. It was released in 2004 by David Heinemeier Hansson, a Danish programmer. Rails is a MVC framework also called model-view-controller. Rails is very useful for default structuring of a database, service and web page viewing.

4. What is a relational database? Are there other kinds of databases?

  Your answer: There are other types of databases besides relational. I'm blanking on the name currently, I want to say functional database? MongoDB is an example of a database that is not relational. Relational databases are better for containing larger sets of data whereas other databases may be better for making calculations with smaller sets of data.

  Researched answer: Relational databases store their data in tables of rows and columns. This can be thought of like a Excel sheet. There are many other types of databases. To list a few, Cloud, Object-oriented, Hierarchical, NoSQL and Wide column databases. Different databases are used accordingly to the saying "The best tool for the job".

5. What are primary keys? Why are they important?

  Your answer: Primary keys are a unique identifier for rows in your PostgreSQL database. They are important for targeting a specific row of data in your database. They are assigned automatically by PostgreSQL, so no need to touch them.

  Researched answer: Primary keys are ids. Ids are always unique and prevents issues of having two entries in the database that contain the same data. You wouldn't want to update someone's information based on their name because you could potentially have two or more people with the same name in your database.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. RESTful routes: A convention pattern to follow when structuring different routes for interacting with the server when an HTTP request is made by the client.

2. JSON: JSON or JavaScript Object Notation is a lightweight data storage format that is easy for humans to read and write.

3. ERB: ERB is embedded Ruby into a text document such as HTML.

4. Params: Params come from the user's browser when the request the page. They are encoded into the URL.

5. API: API or Application Programming Interface is a set of code that tells software how to interact with another piece of software.
